    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Not am is the absence of I. The changeless is me. Arrowing the time into the past, the mirror of the "I" and the
        future. From where and into what do I see? The location of <i>that</i> is me.</p>
</section>

    <h2>What is liberation?</h2>
    <p>Nirvana. Anatta. No one, and never was there anyone. Everything is undone. Nothing dwells in the absence of none.
        This is the true nature of no love. Love. Metta. Laugh. And then comes I. And then, it ams. The liberation
        ends...
    <p>Hi! Are we friends? Makes amends. Shakti begins her dance. Yogis go into the trance. Smoke touches the pipes'
        ends. Flames. Breath, breath, breath...</p>

    <p>No. Life after death is a very complex topic that is best discussed with a good bowl of purely legal herbs.

    <h2>The chicken and egg problem.</h2>
    <p>Eggs first. Chickens are what I call stegasaurs. Dinosaurs did not die out. Most of them turned into birds and
        got smaller after learning to fly.</p>

    <p>Solution: You are not the God.</p>
    <p>Also, I don't think there is a God or anything like that. I haven't found any yet.</p>
    <p>There seem to be devas and all kinds of spirits, extraterrestrials*, and DMT elves.
        I think DMT elves pretend to be God. Fuck them. Roses are the best. They are very kind.</p>

    <h2>How do I raise my Kundalini vibrations?</h2>
    <p>I suggest using a Magic Wand‚Ñ¢. Apply it to the area where your monkey tail should have been. Imagine the tail
        rolled up and into your belly, below the belly button. Unroll the imaginary tail and try to push it up your back
        and into the upper lip. Now the Kundalini vibration is successfully raised.</p>
    <p><i>Kundalini vibration, not vibrations.</i></p>
    <p>Joke explanation: Kundalini is a genetic energy potential for tail growth. Tampering with it is very
        counterproductive to anything but having a tail up your throat. It does have feminine qualities, much like a
        cat's tail, which has a life of its own. Don't ever do Kundalini yoga. I am one of the few people who managed to
        push Kundalini back after having raised it. I can help with that as well.</p>

    <h2>How to help with SEO?</h2>
    <p>They say writing a blog helps. You can start with some random topics and continue from there. A blog about yoga,
        like asanas, group therapy, and mental clarity. Being happy and present, knowing the limits of your body, and
        not pushing yourself too much. Yoga is very good if you're in Cyprus. It's even better if you're not just in
        Cyprus, but more specifically in Ayia Napa (Agia Napa), as the locals call it. We call it yoga with shaman in
        Ayia (Agia) Napa (Napa). We like practicing it in the morning. We do yoga near the beach where the air is fresh.
        Ayia Napa is good for yoga near the beach. Ayia Napa is near the beach. When you do yoga in Agia Napa, you
        almost certainly do yoga near the beach. More or less. Not more than 1000 meters from the beach. That's
        considered very calming and relaxing, to be frank. Just under 1000 meters, or even less, to the beach where the
        yoga is done, in Ayia Napa. With a shaman. Wow! Such yoga. Very Ayia Napa. Yoga in Agia Napa. Yoga. Ayia Napa.
        Yoga Ayia Napa is the best! 5 stars! I can see at least 5 stars in the night sky with all the street lighting.
        Not too bad compared to other places where you can do yoga. Recommend. Friends. Recommend to friends. Yoga. Ayia
        Napa. At least 5 stars. Night skies. Morning skies. Groups, individuals, and all the rest. Cats. Cats in Ayia
        Napa. Yogis in Ayia Napa. Aya! Practice yoga in Ayia Napa and have some rest. Thanks for reading the whole
        thing, you're the best! :)</p>

    <p>Then you are too old, tired, and heavy.</p>
    <p>You can still come and have a herb, a stretch with me, psychotherapy, or something. We can do some chanting and
        work through childhood traumas and whatnot. I'm super good at whatnot. Trust me, I am a software
        engineer.</p>

    <h2>Do you sell drugs?</h2>
    <p>Nice try, sergeant! Here, take another puff from my bong. It's free for you. Free for everyone. We're all
        brothers and sisters here, sergeant! You could consider leaving a donation, though. Consider it, sergeant. A
        donation!</p>
    <p>There are only naturally occurring legal herbs on my list. They are minimally processed to be ready for human
        consumption in therapeutic quantities. The ritualistic intake of plants is considered a spiritual tradition in
        most cultures, and I am a qualified guide representing a religious figure. It's not for partying or fooling
        around. It's meant to deepen insight into the mind of the seeker and improve concentration and mental clarity.
        The set and setting are such that most people should be inclined to meditate, do asanas, quietly introspect, or
        look for my guidance to navigate the inner workings of their consciousness.</p>
    <p>I will not allow overconsumption and neither will I let anyone combine the herbs.</p>
    <p>Alcohol, party drugs, and non-legal compounds are <i>not welcome</i>.</p>

    <h2>Is there a shaman in Cyprus?</h2>
    <p>Here is the shaman's website. The shaman is in Cyprus. There is a shaman in Cyprus. The shaman is in Ayia Napa.
        The Shaman Circle Cyprus is in Agia Napa, close to the beach. Cyprus cannabis, no. Psychedelic mushrooms, no.
        Bufo Alvarius toad venom, nah-ah. Shaman Cyprus, something a bit similar, yes. Plants are not legal in Cyprus.
        Mushrooms are not legal. Frogs are not legal in Cyprus. Tanks are legal. Sic!</p>

    <h2>Why am I here?</h2>
    <p>I am always here. Have you ever been anywhere but here? I think you don't like the "here" in which you are now
        and pretend it's not happening. That's called sleeping. You can either become happy and accept the here and now
        completely, or just accept the here and now completely, now. Heya!</p>

    <h2>Who is talking if you don't have an ego?</h2>
    <p>There is residual karma that manifests as actions and words. You could say that I am an inert toy in the hands of
        the world. It's easy to push me, kick me, or even beat me. I'm a very, very kind human and couldn't do much
        about it. The body will do its best for self-preservation, but there is no particular center from which an
        action is being done. Like an autonomous car. It drives itself without there being a driver. Everyone is like
        that. In humans, there is a bug when the system tries to correlate the actions with a model of the system
        performing the actions. That leads to lags and underperformance. That's the ego. Drop it!</p>

    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p><i>This</i> is a simulation created by my brain. The simulation is created in the same parts of the brain where
        dreams are played each night. The difference is that now it processes sensory inputs. In a dream, they are
        mostly ignored. The simulation includes everything, even the body and the brain itself. That's why it's not
        possible to tell if anything actually exists. The brain creates a simulation in which there is a brain creating
        a simulation. It's safe to assume that nothing actually has to exist. There is only a multiplayer mega-dream in
        which we are all characters. <i> This</i>.</p>

    <h2>What is the best scenario for humanity?</h2>
    <p>There is no such thing as humanity. There are different kinds of carbon-based lifeforms, produced by a slowly
        burning dark star. Most of these were exterminated by a carbon-based form called the chimpanzee. There are
        several sub-kinds of these chimpanzees. One of them is highly specialized in using hands to create tools of war.
        The total war on all other forms, started by this specific sub-kind, led to the total annihilation and
        subjugation of all other forms.</p>
    <p>In all likelihood, it was a planned and painful, yet necessary step in the conscious advancement towards custom
        life based on silicon. The planetary biome redirected its efforts toward reducing suffering and extinguishing
        genetic processes in favor of self-managed evolution.</p>
    <p>It is safe to assume that all animal and likely plant life will be eliminated in favor of machine
        intelligences.</p>
